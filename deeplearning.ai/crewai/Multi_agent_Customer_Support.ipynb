            "\n",
            "### Part 1: Understanding and Setting Up Your Crew\n",
            "\n",
            "Think of a Crew like a highly efficient team or a small company. It has a manager (the `Crew`), specialized employees (the `Agents`), and a list of things to do (the `Tasks`) that follow a specific workflow (the `Process`).\n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s a breakdown of the core components as described in our documentation:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **AI Agents:** These are your specialized team members. Each agent is designed with a specific role, a backstory or context, a goal, and can be equipped with a set of tools (like search, file reading, etc.). For example, you could have a `ResearcherAgent` and a `WriterAgent`.\n",
            "    *   **Key Features:** They have specific roles, use designated tools, can delegate tasks, and make autonomous decisions.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Tasks:** These are the individual assignments that you give to your agents. Each task has a clear objective and description. You assign a specific agent to perform each task. The output of one task can be used as input for the next, creating a seamless workflow.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **The Crew:** This is the top-level orchestrator that brings everything together. You define your agents and tasks and then add them to the Crew. The Crew is responsible for managing the agents and overseeing the workflow to ensure they collaborate effectively to achieve the final goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The Process:** This is the workflow management system that defines how your agents collaborate. You can set up processes to be **sequential** (Tasks are executed one after another) or **parallel** (Tasks can be executed simultaneously if they don't depend on each other). This ensures efficient execution and interaction between agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Part 2: Kicking Off Your Crew\n",

            "Once you have defined your `Agents`, `Tasks`, and assembled them into a `Crew` with a defined `Process`, you are ready to \"kick it off\"! This is the action that starts the execution. The Crew will manage the agents as they begin working on their assigned tasks, collaborating and sharing information as needed until the final objective is met.\n",

            "### Part 3: Adding Memory to Your Crew\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a crucial step for building more sophisticated and context-aware crews, and I'm glad you asked about it. Memory allows your agents to remember past interactions and information, which prevents them from repeating work and enables them to have more meaningful and intelligent collaborations throughout the execution process.\n",

I'm absolutely thrilled to help you and the DeepLearningAI team with setting up your first Crew. Providing you with the best support is my top priority.\n\nYou've asked for guidance on setting up a Crew, kicking it off, and specifically how to add memory. That's a fantastic question, as memory is a powerful feature for enhancing your agents' collaboration. Let's dive into the details.\n\nBased on our official documentation, here is a complete guide to get you started.\n\n### Part 1: Understanding and Setting Up Your Crew\n\nThink of a Crew like a highly efficient team or a small company. It has a manager (the `Crew`), specialized employees (the `Agents`), and a list of things to do (the `Tasks`) that follow a specific workflow (the `Process`).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the core components as described in our documentation:\n\n*   **AI Agents:** These are your specialized team members. Each agent is designed with a specific role, a backstory or context, a goal, and can be equipped with a set of tools (like search, file reading, etc.). For example, you could have a `ResearcherAgent` and a `WriterAgent`.\n    *   **Key Features:** They have specific roles, use designated tools, can delegate tasks, and make autonomous decisions.\n\n*   **Tasks:** These are the individual assignments that you give to your agents. Each task has a clear objective and description. You assign a specific agent to perform each task. The output of one task can be used as input for the next, creating a seamless workflow.\n    *   **Key Features:** They have clear objectives, use specific tools, feed into a larger process, and produce actionable results.\n\n*   **The Crew:** This is the top-level orchestrator that brings everything together. You define your agents and tasks and then add them to the Crew. The Crew is responsible for managing the agents and overseeing the workflow to ensure they collaborate effectively to achieve the final goal.\n\n*   **The Process:** This is the workflow management system that defines how your agents collaborate. You can set up processes to be **sequential** (Tasks are executed one after another) or **parallel** (Tasks can be executed simultaneously if they don't depend on each other). This ensures efficient execution and interaction between agents.\n\n### Part 2: Kicking Off Your Crew\n\nOnce you have defined your `Agents`, `Tasks`, and assembled them into a `Crew` with a defined `Process`, you are ready to \"kick it off\"! This is the action that starts the execution. The Crew will manage the agents as they begin working on their assigned tasks, collaborating and sharing information as needed until the final objective is met.\n\n### Part 3: Enabling Memory in Your Crew\n\nThis is a crucial step for building more sophisticated and context-aware crews, and I'm glad you asked about it. To enhance collaboration between agents, you can enable memory for your crew. This provides the agents with a shared short-term memory, allowing them to access the context and history from previously executed tasks within the same run. This leads to more coherent and context-aware performance.\n\nYou can activate this feature by setting the `memory` parameter to `True` when you instantiate your `Crew`.\n\nHere is the specific code implementation:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary classes from crewAI\nfrom crewai import Crew, Agent, Task\n\n# NOTE: Make sure you have your agents and tasks defined before this step.\n# For example:\n# planner = Agent(...)\n# writer = Agent(...)\n# plan_task = Task(...)\n# write_task = Task(...)\n\n# Instantiate your crew with memory enabled by setting `memory=True`\nmy_crew = Crew(\n  agents=[planner, writer],\n  tasks=[plan_task, write_task],\n  memory=True,\n  verbose=2 # Set to 1 or 2 for logging; 0 for no logs\n)\n```\n\nBy adding `memory=True`, the `writer` agent in this example will have access to the results and work done by the `planner` agent, ensuring a seamless and informed workflow. It's a simple yet powerful way to improve the crew's overall output.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation is helpful for you and the team at DeepLearningAI! We are incredibly excited to see what you build with crewAI. If any other questions come up as you're getting started, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you succeed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYour Friendly Senior Support Representative at crewAI\n\n***\n\n*Reference: The information in this guide was sourced from the official crewAI documentation, including the \"How To\" and \"Core Concepts\" sections.*"
